# Robot Arm Control System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for controlling a robot arm using an MKL05Z32 development board, 4 servos, and an LCD display.

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust control system for a robot arm using C programming language. The system is designed to interface with an MKL05Z32 development board, controlling 4 servos to manipulate the robot arm's movements. Additionally, an LCD display is utilized to provide feedback about each joint rotation.

## Components

- **MKL05Z32 Development Board**: The main microcontroller board used for interfacing with the servos and LCD display, as well as executing the control software.
- **4 Servos**: These servos are responsible for actuating different joints of the robot arm.
- **LCD Display**: Provides status information regarding the movement of each joint.
